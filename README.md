Hello! This repository tracks my career track records. I find this way to version control and deploying static pages via GitHub/GitLab pages, because life is like a git. You need to always commit to something, sometimes push and pull. Oh yeah, I do not like conflicts/issues.

## Usage

I will soon provide a container script for easy building. For now for local building:
```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
